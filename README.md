This is a collection of Python functions - based on my own work solving some 'basic' Rosalind's Problems - my account:

1. Counting DNA nucleotides - countaa.py
2. Counting point mutation - hamming.py
3. Strings and Lists - string_list.py
4. Variables and some arithmetic - var_arithmetic.py
5. Conditions and loops - cond_loop.py
6. Dictionaries - dict_ss.py
7. Transcribing (from DNA to RNA) - transcribe.py

I am making this repository for my own reference.
